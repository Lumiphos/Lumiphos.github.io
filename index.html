                The affinity diagram contains six sections. These sections refer to the structure of our system, the marketing, the accessibility of this system,
                the hurdles that we may need to face with this system, and some features that will definitely be included.

              Penelope is hungry between classes. She doesn't have her own car, so she would need to rely on the school's free transportation to go
              get food between classes. However, she doesn't want to use the free transportation, since it can be very unreliable, and she doesn't
              want to be late to her next class. Thankfully, Demeter Grocer is there to save her day. With Demeter Grocer, she is finally able to get food, without
              having that time cut into classes.

      <p>
                   A paper prototype of the app, Demeter Grocer. There, you can search for food to buy. After selecting what you want to purchase, you can see what stores
                   near you sell that particular product, and even request a ride to that store through the app. You can view your profile where you can change the app's
                   appearance, and view your notifications. You can also favorite a particular product or shop, and view them under your Favorites tab. Through the
                   Favorites tab, you can also rate the app, or your drivers.

      <p>
                  This is Demeter Grocer's Hi-Fi Prototype. The app uses a simple 3-step process  to accomplish the goal of allowing a user to purchase groceries.
                  The Home page has 3 buttons, one for each step. On each page, the "Demeter Grocer" at the top of the page sends you back to the home page. The 
                  "Search Items" page lets you search for products, and add them to a cart. The "Locate Nearby Shops" page finds nearby shops that sell the items 
                  in your cart, and lets you select which one to buy from. The "Request A Ride" page confirms your order, gives you a confirmation page, and tracks 
                  a driver that will take you to and from the store.
