                The affinity diagram contains six sections. These sections refer to the structure of our system, the marketing, the accessibility of this system,
                the hurdles that we may need to face with this system, and some features that will definitely be included.

              Penelope is hungry between classes. She doesn't have her own car, so she would need to rely on the school's free transportation to go
              get food between classes. However, she doesn't want to use the free transportation, since it can be very unreliable, and she doesn't
              want to be late to her next class. Thankfully, Demeter Grocer is there to save her day. With Demeter Grocer, she is finally able to get food, without
              having that time cut into classes.
